The objective of the Project is to build a multi-threaded dictionary server that handles
concurrent client-requested operations to demonstrate four main functionalities: query the
meaning of a word, add a new word and its meaning, remove an existing word, and update
the meaning. The dictionary follows a client-server architecture which implements two
fundamental technologies — sockets and threads — at the lowest level of abstraction of
network communication and concurrency. The reliable communications between server and
clients is demonstrated using TCP and errors or exceptions such as invalid inputs, failure in
network commination, and dictionary file I/O are handled properly and notified in the
Graphical User Interface (GUI).
